# Search-and-Sample-Return

This project is modeled after the NASA Sample Return Challenge and consists of implementing code that will be used to operate a Rover in a simulated environment to map its surroundings, make decisions on how to navigate the terrain avoiding obstacles and, as a bonus, to colect some sample rocks and return to the starting point.
